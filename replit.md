# Overview

This is a beginner-friendly Python educational project that demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts through a simple "Hello, World!" program. The project serves as an introduction to Python syntax, functions, variables, string formatting, error handling, and documentation practices. It's designed as a learning resource for new Python developers to understand basic programming concepts in a clear, well-documented manner.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: The entire program is contained within `hello_world.py`, making it simple and easy to understand for beginners
- **Function-based design**: Uses a `main()` function as the entry point, demonstrating proper Python program structure and organization
- **Educational focus**: Code is heavily commented and documented to serve as a learning tool

## Core Design Patterns
- **Error handling**: Implements basic try-catch exception handling to demonstrate defensive programming practices
- **Documentation standards**: Uses docstrings and inline comments to explain functionality and demonstrate good documentation practices
- **Modular approach**: Uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern to make the script both executable and importable

## Programming Concepts Demonstrated
- **Basic I/O operations**: Uses `print()` function for console output
- **Variable assignment and usage**: Shows string variables and f-string formatting
- **Function definition**: Demonstrates function creation with proper documentation
- **String manipulation**: Shows string concatenation and formatting techniques
- **Program flow control**: Implements basic control structures and return codes

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Requirements
- **Python 3**: The program requires Python 3.x runtime environment
- **Standard library only**: No external packages or dependencies required - uses only built-in Python functionality

## Development Environment
- **No additional tooling**: Can be run directly from command line without any build tools or package managers
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Designed to run on any system with Python 3 installed
