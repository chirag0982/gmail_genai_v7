# AI Email Assistant

## Overview

The AI Email Assistant is a Flask-based web application designed to revolutionize professional email communication through AI-powered assistance. The application leverages multiple AI models (Qwen-4, Claude-4, and GPT-4o) to generate contextually appropriate email replies, provide intelligent suggestions, and enable real-time team collaboration on email drafts. Built natively for Replit's cloud infrastructure, it offers enterprise-grade features including multi-tenant support, advanced analytics, and zero-configuration deployment.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
AI Model Integration: Successfully added OpenRouter Qwen model (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507) for professional and technical email generation.
LangChain Enhancement: Comprehensive LangChain functionality integrated with chains, memory, agents, and structured output parsing.
